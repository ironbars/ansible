`/etc/ansible/development/files/`
=================================

<!---
The tasks here should be to: 

1. Copy `bash_profile` to `~/.bash_profile` on the remote machine
2. Copy `bashrc` to `~/.bashrc` on the remote machine
3. Copy the `bash` directory whole to `~/.config/bash`
-->

Treat this directory as virtual '/' and copy all files to their appropriate 
places based on this hierarchy.
